I do my best to make my research reproducible. Here are some codes related to my publications. 

*** Reproducible Research ***
* [**A sparse reconstruction framework for Fourier-based plane wave imaging**](https://gitlab.com/abesson/Sparse_regularization_Fourier)<br>
MATLAB code used to generate the results of the paper: [A sparse reconstruction framework for Fourier-based plane wave imaging](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7582552/)

* [** A compressed-sensing approach for ultrasound imaging **]<br>
Code used to reproduce the results of the abstract submitted to [SPARS 2017](http://spars2017.lx.it.pt/). <i>Coming soon</i>

*** Latex ***
* [**Student-report's template**](https://gitlab.com/latex-templates/LTS5-student-project-report)<br>
Template for semester and master projects reports.
