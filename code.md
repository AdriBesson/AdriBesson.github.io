I do my best to make my research reproducible and you can find code associated with my publications on the publication page. Here are some pieces of code related to my

### Courses

* [**Statistical Machine learning - EPFL MATH-412**](https://github.com/AdriBesson/Statistical_learning_course)<br> Python notebooks for the EPFL course [Statistical machine learning](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/statistical-learning-MATH-412). You can find code related to exercises for weeks 1, 4 and 5 as well as for the project. I implemented several interesting statistical learning tools (subset selection, linear models) and extensively used sklearn.

* [**Gender recognition by voice**](https://github.com/AdriBesson/Gender_recoginition_speech)<br> The objective is to predict whether a voice recording is 'male' or 'female' based on spectral features extracted from the each recording. The dataset, available on Kaggle, is a '.csv' file which consists of features extracted 3248 voice recordings.


### Latex

* [**Student-report's template**](https://gitlab.com/latex-templates/LTS5-student-project-report)<br>
Template for semester and master projects reports.

* [** Example poster **](https://github.com/AdriBesson/spars2017-poster)<br>
Example poster I use in scientific conferences. Feel free to use it!
