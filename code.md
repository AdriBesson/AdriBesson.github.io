I do my best to make my research reproducible and you can find code associated with my publications on the publication page. Here are pieces of code related to some other projects/courses. Feel free to visit my [Github](https://github.com/AdriBesson) to have a more exhaustive list!

### Courses

* [**Statistical Machine learning - EPFL MATH-412**](https://github.com/AdriBesson/Statistical_learning_course)<br> Python notebooks for the EPFL course [Statistical machine learning](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/statistical-learning-MATH-412). You can find code related to exercises for weeks 1, 4 and 5 as well as for the project. I implemented several interesting statistical learning tools (subset selection, linear models) and extensively used sklearn.

* [**SMS spam filtering**](https://github.com/dperdios/sms-spam-filtering)<br> We study various short message service spam filtering techniques based on a Kaggle dataset composed of 5572 messages, whose 4825 are legitimate and 747 are spam. The Bag-of-Words models followed by term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency transformation is employed for feature extraction. Several state-of-the-art classifiers are compared, i.e. logistic regression, regularized logistic regression, linear and kernel support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours, multinomial Bayes, decision trees, random forests, AdaBoost and neural networks, where the best hyper-parameters are identified using 10-fold cross validation. We demonstrate that all the classifiers perform remarkably well in terms of misclassification error and that even simple linear methods, such as logistic regression leads to less than 2% of misclassification error. We study two resampling methods that can be used to counter the class imbalance present in the training set, i.e. downsampling of the majority class and upsampling of the minority class. We show that both lead to an increase of the sensitivity at the cost of a lower specificity. Online learning strategies are finally investigated, where the algorithms sequentially update with a new batch of messages, mimicking a more realistic example. 

* [**Gender recognition by voice**](https://github.com/AdriBesson/Gender_recoginition_speech)<br> The objective is to predict whether a voice recording is 'male' or 'female' based on spectral features extracted from the each recording. The dataset, available on Kaggle, is a '.csv' file which consists of features extracted 3248 voice recordings.


### Latex

* [**Student-report's template**](https://gitlab.com/latex-templates/LTS5-student-project-report)<br>
Template for semester and master projects reports.

* [**Example poster**](https://github.com/AdriBesson/spars2017-poster)<br>
Example poster I use in scientific conferences. Feel free to use it!
