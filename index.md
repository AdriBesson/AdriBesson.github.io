I'm a PhD student in [Prof. Jean-Philippe Thiran](http://lts5www.epfl.ch/thiran.html)'s [LTS 5 laboratory](http://lts5www.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). My PhD thesis is also supervised by [Prof. Yves Wiaux](https://pureapps2.hw.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/yves-wiaux(3992c9b1-3ec7-4015-a4cb-228f0f4c7b82).html), head of the [Biomedical and Astronomical Signal Processing Group](https://www.hw.ac.uk/schools/engineering-physical-sciences/institutes/sensors-signals-systems/basp.htm) at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/index.htm).

<br />
Previously, I was as a R&D engineer at <a href="http://www.morpho.com/en/about-us" target="_blank">Safran Identity and Security</a> where I worked on two projects. One aimed at developing an anti-fraud module for the <a href="http://www.morpho.com/en/biometric-terminals/oem-modules/fingerprint-modules/morphosmart-cbm-series" target="_blank">MorphoSmart CBM series</a>. The second aimed at designing <a href="http://www.morpho.com/fr/atom/124" target="_blank">MorphoPass</a>, the checkpoint of the future. 

<br />
I am an applied mathematician and an engineer. I hold a MsC in Information Theory from <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>, Lausanne, Switzerland, and an engineering degree from <a href="http://www.supelec.fr/" target="_blank">Sup√©lec</a>, Paris, France.
