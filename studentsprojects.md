Below are listed the semester and master projects I am supervising or co-supervising this semester (Spring 2017). A <strong>semester project</strong> corresponds to approximately 10 ECTS (= 10 working hours per week) and a <strong>master project</strong> corresponds to 30 ECTS (full time at the lab).<br> 
An exhaustive of all the projects proposed in LTS 5 is available [here](http://lts5www.epfl.ch/student_projects.html).

### Master projects

* [**Characterization of ultrasound acoustic wave propagation through heterogeneous media for through-the-skull medical ultrasound imaging**](https://adribesson.github.io/Students_projects/Spring 2017/Master projects/Transcranial.pdf)<br>

* [**Dictionary learning for compressed sensing reconstruction in ultrasound imaging**](https://adribesson.github.io/Students_projects/Spring 2017/Master projects/Dictionary_learning.pdf)<br>

* [**Deep learning for enhanced ultrasound image reconstruction**](https://adribesson.github.io/Students_projects/Spring 2017/Master projects/Deep_learning.pdf)<br>

### Semester projects

* [**Extension of the compressed sensing based medical ultrasound imaging demonstrator to doppler flow imaging**](https://adribesson.github.io/Students_projects/Spring 2017/Semester projects/Doppler_flow.pdf)<br>
